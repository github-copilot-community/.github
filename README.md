Welcome to the GitHub Copilot Community Organisation! :wave:

This organisation contains open source initiatives created by developers at GitHub (and around the world) to show the art of the possible with Copilot. :octocat: :computer:

[GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/using-github-copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot) consists of [Copilot for Individuals](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/copilot-individual/about-github-copilot-individual), [Copilot Business](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/copilot-business/about-github-copilot-business) and [Copilot Enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/github-copilot-enterprise/overview/about-github-copilot-enterprise). 

A core principle of each of these solutions is being automated and integrable via API's and Webhooks. In this organisation, you will find starter kits, scripts and full-blown solutions that show off how you can integrate into GitHub Copilot. 

In comparison to the official GitHub organisation, a lot of the software you find here is developed as a best effort. These are open-source solutions developed outside of core responsibilities but with the aim for you to leverage and consume as you would any standard open-source software. :open_hands: 

We love contributions and feedback from you! So please feel free to open pull requests and issues as you can! :two_hearts:

Welcome and we hope what you find here useful :bow:
